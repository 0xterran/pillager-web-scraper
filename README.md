## Why Pillager?

Pillager is good for when you want to scrape a website as a human while navigating its graphical UI. It's convinent for scraping websites that require authentication or have complex UIs. It's also good for scraping websites that have dynamic content that is hard to scrape with traditional web scraping tools.

You can imagine web scraping methods along this spectrum:

- (A) Cloud scale web scraping: Complex setup and heavy duty
- (B) Paid service web scraping: Easy cloud scale but costs money
- (C) Visual web scraping: For beginners but struggles with complex UIs

Pillager is (A) heavy duty with simpler setup, (B) free with smaller cloud scale, and (C) handles complex UIs well. It is ideal for low-code developers.
